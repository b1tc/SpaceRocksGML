We replaced procedural code in obj_camera > Room Start and obj_camera > Step events that track a 
target object in a viewport with the camera.  Because this code is needed in both these events
we replaced the code with a script function named track_with_camera.

In both events the function call is the same,

	track_with_camera(view_camera[0], target);
	
The 


//TRACK WITH CAMERA OLD PROCEDURE
	if instance_exists(target)
	{
		// Keep in mind that cameras are anchored to top left
		// so we have to shift our camera to the center.
		 global.cameraX = target.x - global.cameraWidth/2;
		 global.cameraY = target.y - global.cameraHeight/2;
	 
		 // clamp camera so room wrap is smoother
		 global.cameraX = clamp(global.cameraX,0,room_width-global.cameraWidth);
		 global.cameraY = clamp(global.cameraY,0,room_width-global.cameraHeight);
	}

	 camera_set_view_pos(view_camera[0],global.cameraX, global.cameraY);
