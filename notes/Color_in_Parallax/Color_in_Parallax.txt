Either as an addition or an alternative color can be used to describe a sense of distance and atmospheric perspective in our landscapes.

6 ways to increase depth in a landscape painting

1. Overlap objects within your composition so that some are forced forward or backward in the scene.
2. Paint with less detail, texture, and definition the further back you go in the landscape.
3. Paint using lighter values and less contrast for distant elements.
4. Use cooler colors to push elements farther into the background.
5. Use warmer, darker colors to bring elements forward into the foreground.
6. As elements recede in the distance, paint them at a much smaller scale than objects in the foreground.
