Video 10 Space Mods - GML - Enemy Factions (1/3) - GameMaker Studio 2

This is a planning video with no code added to the project.

We introduce three enemy ships that share similar properties but have properties and behaviors of their own that make them unique.

All enemy ship collisions with our players bullet result in loss of HP or elimination, i.e., all enemy ships will have collision with obj_bullet. We can create a Parent Object for enemies that all enemies inherit from. Now we can have obj_bullet collision with enemy parent object. The enemy parent object is also useful to set up shared properties with the enemy ships.

Note: The enemy ships also fire bullets and all bullet object will have similar behavior.
Set up a Faction System where all objects belong to a certain faction.

When an ally creates a bullet we set the bullets alignment to the allies.
When an enemy creates a bullet we set the bullets alignment to the enemies.
Note: The "Ally" and "Enemy" objects are parent objects and their children are denoted by the vertical inheritance lines.

See the explanation in SpaceRocksGML Projects Issue #8.
