We moved the asteroid spawning procedure into a script function because it is used in both 
obj_game > Room Start and obj_game > Alarm0.

In obj_game > Room Start it is used to spawn in the 6 initial asteroids at the start of the game.

// Spawn Initial Asteroids (ORIGINAL PROCEDURE)
	repeat(6)
	{
		var xx = choose( 
			irandom_range(0, room_width * 0.3), 
			irandom_range(room_width * 0.3, room_width) 
		);
		var yy = choose( 
			irandom_range(0, room_height * 0.3), 
			irandom_range(room_height * 0.3, room_height) 
		);
		instance_create_layer(xx, yy ,"Instances", obj_asteroid);
	}


In obj_game > Alarm0 it is used to spawn in asteroids every 4 seconds.

// Spawn Asteroids (ORIGINAL PROCEDURE)
	// flip a coin
	if choose(0,1) == 0
	{
		// go down the side
		var xx = choose(0, room_width);
		var yy = irandom_range(0, room_height);
	}
	else
	{
		// go top or bottom	
		var xx = irandom_range(0, room_width);
		var yy = choose(0, room_height);
	}

	instance_create_layer(xx,yy,"Instances", obj_asteroid);



NOTES: 

[1] The function function spawn_off_camera(obj, num) is written more generally to be accomodate
the spawn of other game objects like enemies and power-ups.

[2] Alarm0 was originally set to 4 seconds before we moved to the script function spawn_off_camera(obj, num). 
Now, because the room is larger we spawn additional asteroids every 1 second instead of 4.  

	// repeat alarm every 4 seconds
	alarm[0] = game_get_speed(gamespeed_fps) * 4;

was changed to 1 seconds because room is larger

	// repeat alarm every 1 seconds
	alarm[0] = game_get_speed(gamespeed_fps) * 1;
